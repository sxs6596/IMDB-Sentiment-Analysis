# Sentiment Analysis Model Playground 🎢

This project lets you play with state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models on movie review data! 🍿🎬

It includes a web dashboard for interactive testing. You can see how different deep learning techniques perform in real-time.

Behind the scenes, techniques like CNNs, RNNs, Hybrid, BLSTM, and BERT are crunching away on IMDB review data. The goal is to classify the overall sentiment of each review (positive / negative).

The dashboard provides:

👉 Real-time sentiment predictions as you type
👉 Comparisons between different models  
👉 Aggregate sentiment scoring across multiple entered reviews

This lets you get hands-on with sentiment analysis approaches like:

- LSTM networks
- CNN classifiers
- Hybrid architectures
- Attention-based transformers like BERT

## Getting Started

The model training scripts are in `/models` and web app code is in `/app`.
